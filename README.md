## <a name='Aboutdoki'></a>About doki

Douki-next (同期『ネクスト』) is a sync software for [anilist](https://anilist.co) and [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net) account. The purpose of douki is to merge your anilist to your animelist ((or vice-versa) precisely , with only certains fields or excluding some, only certain anime or manga, while keeping thing simple and supporting merge in one command.


## <a name='Whydoiki'></a> Why doki

We believe that there are no equivalent to precisely synchronize anilist and myanimelist. With doki you can by simply running a command sync your accounts or more precisely sync only some field.
